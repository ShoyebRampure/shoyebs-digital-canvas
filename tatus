    Fix: SidebarProvider context error
    
    The error "useSidebar must be used within a SidebarProvider" indicates that the `useSidebar` hook is being called outside of the `SidebarProvider`. The fix involves wrapping the components that use `useSidebar` (specifically, the `Index` component) with the `SidebarProvider` in `App.tsx`. This ensures that the necessary context is available.

    Fix: Tailwind CSS class not found
    
    The error message indicates that the `text-foreground` class is not being recognized by Tailwind CSS. This is likely because the class is not defined correctly or is missing from the configuration. The fix involves ensuring that the necessary Tailwind directives are correctly imported and that the color variables are properly defined.
